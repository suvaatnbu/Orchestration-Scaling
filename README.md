Project Steps:

Step 1: Set Up the AWS Environment

1. Set Up AWS CLI and Boto3:

   - Install AWS CLI and configure it with AWS credentials.
   - Install Boto3 for Python and configure it.
Step 2: Prepare the MERN Application
1. Containerize the MERN Application:
   - Ensure the MERN application is containerized using Docker. Create a Dockerfile for each component (frontend and backend).
2. Push Docker Images to Amazon ECR:
   - Build Docker images for the frontend and backend.
   - Create an Amazon ECR repository for each image.
   - Push the Docker images to their respective ECR repositories.
Step 3: Version Control
1. Use AWS CodeCommit:
   - Create a CodeCommit repository.
   - Push the MERN application source code to the CodeCommit repository.
Step 4: Continuous Integration with Jenkins
1. Set Up Jenkins:
   - Install Jenkins on an EC2 instance.
   - Configure Jenkins with necessary plugins.
2. Create Jenkins Jobs:
   - Create Jenkins jobs for building and pushing Docker images to ECR.
   - Trigger the Jenkins jobs whenever there's a new commit in the CodeCommit repository.
Step 5: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Boto3
1. Define Infrastructure with Boto3 (Python Script):
   - Use Boto3 to define the infrastructure (VPC, subnets, security groups).
   - Define an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for the backend.
   - Create AWS Lambda functions if needed.
Step 6: Deploying Backend Services
1. Deploy Backend on EC2 with ASG:
   - Use Boto3 to deploy EC2 instances with the Dockerized backend application in the ASG.
Step 7: Set Up Networking
1. Create Load Balancer:
   - Set up an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for the backend ASG.
2. Configure DNS:
   - Set up DNS using Route 53 or any other DNS service.
Step 8: Deploying Frontend Services
1. Deploy Frontend on EC2:
   - Use Boto3 to deploy EC2 instances with the Dockerized frontend application.
Step 9: AWS Lambda Deployment
1. Create Lambda Functions:
- Use Boto3 to create AWS Lambda functions for specific tasks within the application.
- Backup of Db using Lambda Functions and store in S3 bucket - put time stamping on the backup
Step 10: Kubernetes (EKS) Deployment


1. Create EKS Cluster:
   - Use eksctl or other tools to create an Amazon EKS cluster.
2. Deploy Application with Helm:
   - Use Helm to package and deploy the MERN application on EKS.
Step 11: Monitoring and Logging
1. Set Up Monitoring:
   - Use CloudWatch for monitoring and setting up alarms.


2. Configure Logging:
   - Use CloudWatch Logs or another logging solution for collecting logs.
Step 12: Documentation
1. Document the Architecture:
 - Instruct learners to create documentation for the entire architecture and deployment process.
 - Put everything on the GitHub
Step 13: Final Checks


1. Validate the Deployment:
   - Ensure that the MERN application is accessible and functions correctly.
BONUS: ChatOps


Step 14: ChatOps Integration
Create SNS Topics:


1.	Use Boto3 to create SNS topics for different events (e.g., deployment success, failure).
2.	Create Lambda for ChatOps:
1.	Write a Lambda function that sends notifications to the appropriate SNS topics based on deployment events.
2.	Integrate ChatOps with Messaging Platform:
3.	Configure integrations with a messaging platform (e.g., Slack/MS Teams/ Telegram) to receive notifications from SNS.
4.	Configure SES
